# The NRE Labs Curriculum

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nre-learning/nrelabs-curriculum.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nre-learning/nrelabs-curriculum)

This repository houses the curriculum for [NRE Labs](https://labs.networkreliability.engineering), a site for
teaching network automation in the browser using real, interactive, compelling virtual environments.

It's powered by the [Antidote](https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote) project, which provides a platform for representing curriculum-as-code, meaning all learning materials can be represented as simple text files, stored in a Git repo. This repo houses exactly that - all of the learning materials for the NRE Labs curriculum.

Contributions of all kinds to this curriculum are not only welcome, but encouraged! Please first read the [contribution guide](https://antidoteproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute-nrelabs/index.html) for information on not only how to contribute, but some of the key ideas and philosophies behind the curriculum.
