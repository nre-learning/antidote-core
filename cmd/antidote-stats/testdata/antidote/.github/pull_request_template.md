**High-Level Overview of this Curriculum Contribution**:

<!--

It's really hard to understand the "why" behind a curriculum contribution/PR just by looking at the files diff.
Take a minute to explain the intention behind your contribution, such as why you built this, and
the kind of audience you had in mind for the content.

Some ideas:
1. Is this a brand new lesson, or an additional stage/lab for an existing lesson?
2. If a new lesson, how does this relate (if applicable) to existing lesson content? Is there overlap, or dependent
   relationships with existing content?
3. Also if this is a new lesson please provide an outline/ToC for this lesson, with a brief explanation of what
   the learner should be expected to learn/accomplish in each
4. Who is your ideal audience/learners for this content?
