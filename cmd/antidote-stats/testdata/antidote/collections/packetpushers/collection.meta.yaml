    Packet Pushers is a community of IT practitioners & vendors who write, podcast, and help each other as industry professionals. The community is built primarily around our podcast network. We have several shows, seen in the top bar of this site. Packet Pushers covers networking as well as data center design, virtualization, and general technology trends.

    The key for us is to make the content focused, practical, and deep, while at the same time having a bit of fun.

    Packet Pushers is a full-time business supported by sponsorships from IT vendors. All sponsored content is clearly marked and still technical. We have vendors bring on technical folks and engineers to discuss their products at a meaningful level. We insist that our vendors offer value to our audience even while performing acts of marketing.
