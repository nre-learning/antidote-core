# This file tells the frr package which daemons to start.
#
# Sample configurations for these daemons can be found in
# /usr/share/doc/frr/examples/.
#
# ATTENTION:
#
# When activating a daemon for the first time, a config file, even if it is
# empty, has to be present *and* be owned by the user and group "frr", else
# the daemon will not be started by /etc/init.d/frr. The permissions should
# be u=rw,g=r,o=.
# When using "vtysh" such a config file is also needed. It should be owned by
# group "frrvty" and set to ug=rw,o= though. Check /etc/pam.d/frr, too.
#
# The watchfrr and zebra daemons are always started.
bgpd=yes

#
#
# If this option is set the /etc/init.d/frr script automatically loads
# the config via "vtysh -b" when the servers are started.
# Check /etc/pam.d/frr if you intend to use "vtysh"!
