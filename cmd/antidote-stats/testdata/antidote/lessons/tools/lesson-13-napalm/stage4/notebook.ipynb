    "Everything we've done thus far is retrieve information from our network device. While this is a very powerful tool to have, we'll eventually need to make changes on our device. Does NAPALM support this?\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is - yes, it totally does. However, this part isn't always as abstracted as the \"getter\" functions we've seen thus far. By retrieving data, we can focus only on very particular use cases, and NAPALM will do the hard work of translating the retrieved data from vendor-specific APIs into a common format. The problem with trying to do this with configuration data is that vendors have wildly different configuration syntaxes, and it's not very useful to only focus on configuring a small subset of a device's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hopefully this will eventually improve, with the advent of [OpenConfig](http://www.openconfig.net/), models which can be used with the [napalm-yang](https://napalm-yang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/root/supported_models/index.html) project to provide vendor-agnostic configurations. Unfortunately only a handful of vendors currently support OpenConfig.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we end up having to do is construct a vendor-specific configuration outside of NAPALM, such as with a templating language like Jinja, and then pass this in to one of the configuration functions in NAPALM. Let's do that now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you have a variable titled `vqfx1_config` that contains a partial configuration for setting the description of an interface. Ideally you would have built this from a template using Jinja and something like YAML, but we'll just create this explicitly for now so we can learn how to apply it using NAPALM:\n",
