    "When getting started with network automation, you'll undoubtedly start working with device APIs. Whether using a standards-based API like NETCONF, or a vendor-specific REST API, you'll eventually need to interact with one of these to retrieve data from a device, or push configuration changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most APIs of any type have a Python library for making it easy to work with them. Rather than craft your own API calls, you simply import a library like PyEZ (Juniper or PyEAPI (Arista) and use that library's functions to interact with the respective device.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in multi-vendor environments (like most of us have), this can get tedious. We end up having to write some logic that determines which library to use based on the type of device, and then use specific functions within that library, which is usually a totally different experience from library to library.\n",
    "\n",
    "NAPALM is a Python project that abstracts all of these to a common set of functions. In this lesson, we'll use this library to interact with our network devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work with our network device via NAPALM, we need to first import the library. This is done with a simple `import` statement:"
