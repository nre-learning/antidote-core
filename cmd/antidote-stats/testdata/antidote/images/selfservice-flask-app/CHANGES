Flask-Bootstrap Changelog
=========================

The following changes are not backwards compatible or major new features
(bugfixes or new upstream releases are not explicitly listed):

3.3.7.0
-------
* Most likely to be the last major Bootstrap 3 release (see
  https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/20631). Make sure you pin
  Flask-Bootstrap's version to `<4` to avoid inadvertent updates.

3.3.5.7
-------
* IE-specific meta information and viewport meta tags have been added to the
  base template.
* The flashed messages are no longer considered "safe", which means HTML-markup
  will be escaped. See :func:`flashed_messages` for more information.
* The ``title`` block now contains an empty-by-default title variable.

3.3.5.3
-------
* Support for `Flask-Nav <http://pythonhosted.org/flask-nav>`_ added:
  :doc:`nav`.
* The sample application has been rewritten to finally resemble a somewhat
  educative piece of code.

3.3.5.2
-------
* ``action`` finally settled on ``""``.

3.3.5.1
-------

* The ``action`` default value of :func:`quick_form` changed to ``.``.
* An ``enctype`` value of :func:`quick_form`, which is the default, will
  automatically add the correct type if a :class:`~wtforms.fields.FileField`
  is present.
* The main bootstrap css file is no longer linked for just ``media="screen"``.

3.3.4.1
-------

* Google Analytics API updated; the legacy API is still available.
* Flashed-message categories are now translated to bootstrap-y categories.

3.3.0.2
-------
* New macro for pagination added (see :doc:`sqlalchemy`).
* New ``utils.html`` macro package added, includes message flashing,
  form-wrapped buttons and icons.
* A class ``required`` is added to wrappers when using ``quick_form()``.

3.2.0.1
-------
* JQuery major version switched from 2 to 1. Detailed information on this change can be found in the :ref:`FAQ <jquery-faq>`.

3.1.0.1
-------
* JQuery version increased to 2.1.0, html5shiv to 3.7 and respond.js to 1.4.2.

3.0.2.1
-------
* Default action for forms changed from "." to nothing.

3.0.0.1
-------
* New major upstream release (backwards incompatible!).
* Sphinx-based Documentation instead of README-file.
* No more SAMPLE_PROJECT, a new sample app has been provided.
* A lot of options are gone, their features being made obsolete, removed or
  integrated into other parts of the extension.
* A new CDN system replaced the old loading system.
* `FontAwesome`_ has been removed in favor of `Glyphicons`_ (which now comes as
  a real font as well).

2.3.2.2
-------
* html5-shim is loaded using a protocol-relative URL
* Rendering of RadioField changed (see sample app).

2.3.2.1
-------
* Slight change in versioning (dot instead of hyphen for the Flask-Bootstrap
  release).

2.3.0-2
-------
* Switched the CDN to `cdnjs <http://cdnjs.com>`_ because `netdna
  <http://bootstrapcdn.com>`_ keeps changing files around too much.
* Introduced ``BOOTSTRAP_CUSTOM_CSS`` option.

2.2.2-1
-------
* `FontAwesome`_ now version 3.0 instead of 2.0.
* The ``navbar()``-macro is gone. It was accidentally committed and never did
  anything useful, so this hopefully won't concern anyone.

2.2.1-1
-------
* `FontAwesome`_ is now supported
  as well, can also be loaded from bootstrapCDN. Set ``BOOTSTRAP_FONTAWESOME``
  to ``True`` to enable it.
* ``BOOTSTRAP_CDN_BASEURL`` is now a dictionary for multiple CDNs (i.e.
  Bootstrap, FontAwesome can use different base URLs). This will break any code
  that relied on setting ``BOOTSTRAP_CDN_BASEURL``.

2.1.1-2
-------
* There is no longer a self.app on Flask-Bootstrap. The extension can be shared
  by any number of applications using ``init_app()`` (though the old
  ``__init__()`` signature is kept for backward compatibiliy).

2.1.1-1
-------
* WTForms generated HTML code is now considered safe. This allows Flask-WTF's
  ``RecaptchaField`` to work with ``quick_form``.

2.1.0-1
-------
* New upstream release: 2.1.0.
* Changed the default version of jQuery from 1.7.2 to just 1. This means that
  the latest 1.x.x version of jQuery will be pulled.
